A comprehensive custom node package for [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) delivering **125+ production-ready nodes** across **18 categories**. Built entirely on the modern **ComfyUI V3 schema**, Ino Nodes covers everything from file system operations and S3 cloud storage to image/video/audio processing, model management, OpenAI integration, and workflow utilities.

Whether you're building automated pipelines that download models from HuggingFace, upload results to S3, process images in batch, or chain LLM calls into your workflows — Ino Nodes provides the building blocks with consistent interfaces, proper error handling, and clean async execution throughout.

Every file-related node follows a unified pattern with `parent_folder` (input/output/temp) selection, `folder`, and `filename` inputs, outputting `success`, `message`, `rel_path`, and `abs_path` for predictable chaining. S3 upload nodes save to temp with unique filenames by default, media download nodes return native ComfyUI types (IMAGE, AUDIO, VIDEO), and all nodes include an `enabled` toggle and descriptive tooltips.

---

> **Important:** This package requires `inopyutils` and `inocloudreve` packages. All S3 operations require S3 credentials configured via environment variables or the S3 Config node. OpenAI and Runpod nodes require their respective API keys. Basic Auth middleware is optional and only activates when `COMFYUI_USERNAME` and `COMFYUI_PASSWORD` are set.
